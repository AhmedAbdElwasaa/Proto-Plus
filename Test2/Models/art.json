    "DeviceDescription": "Marten était le fils d’un riche immigrant flamand, propriétaire d’une prospère raffinerie de sucre à Amsterdam. Plein d’assurance, il posa en 1634 pour Rembrandt qui était alors l’un des peintres portraitistes les plus sollicités d’Amsterdam. Les deux hommes s’étaient probablement rencontrés dans la ville de Leyde où Marten avait fait auparavant des études de droit. Son costume exubérant, garni de dentelle coûteuse et d’extravagantes rosettes à ses souliers, lui valurent au XIXe siècle le qualificatif de ‘dandy’.",

    "DeviceDescription": "The young woman’s clothing is not in keeping with the fashions of Rembrandt’s day, but rather reflects styles of earlier centuries. The woman’s distinctive features – a domed forehead, slightly bulging eyes, and\npronounced chin – are easily recognized in depictions of ancient goddesses and heroines that Rembrandt\npainted in the 1630s. Thus the painting is not strictly a portrait, but a ‘tronie’, or fantasy head.",

    "DeviceDescription": "Enjoying a quiet, private moment, this young woman is absorbed in reading a letter in the morning light. She is still wearing her blue night jacket. All of the colours in the composition are secondary to its radiant lapis lazuli blue. Vermeer recorded the effects of light with extraordinary precision. Particularly innovative is his rendering of the woman’s skin with pale grey, and the shadows on the wall using light blue.",
